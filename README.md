# 🏏 IPL Win Predictor

A machine learning web app built using **Streamlit** that predicts the winning probability of an IPL team based on match situation (target, score, overs, wickets, etc.).

---

## 🚀 Features

* Select batting and bowling teams from official IPL franchises.
* Choose the match city and input target score.
* Real-time inputs for current score, overs completed, and wickets fallen.
* Get instant probability of win/loss for the batting team.
* Built using **Streamlit**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Pickle** pipeline.

## 🧠 Model Training

* The model uses features like:

  * `batting_team`, `bowling_team`, `city`
  * `runs_left`, `balls_left`, `wickets_left`
  * `current run rate (CRR)`, `required run rate (RRR)`
* Encoded categorical features with `OneHotEncoder`.
* Trained using `LogisticRegression` for probability prediction.
* Serialized using `pickle` to `pipe.pkl`.
